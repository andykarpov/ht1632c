# Arduino library to access 24x16 green 3mm dot matrix display from Sure Electronics based on ht1632c controller

This library allows you to perform a basic drawing on that display, such as
* plot dots and lines
* draw squares, circles, rectangles
* fill areas
* scroll text

The library also inclues a php script dotmatrix_font_editor that allows you to create a custom fonts that can be easily included into the library.

Please note, this library uses some external libraries, at least digitalWriteFast:
